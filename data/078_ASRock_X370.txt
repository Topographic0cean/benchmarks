Description The intent is to get a CPU with the most cores and add as much RAM as feasible since I often want to run lots of virtual machines these days.   AMD is pushing cores over performance so that is the best choice and 32GB of RAM is the most I could rationalize for the price.  After 5 years, I upgraded the video card to an MSI GeForce RTX 4070.  Overall, this build remain solid and reliable.
